# Handmade Network Wishlist

This is the [Handmade Network](https://handmade.network/) wishlist, where we suggest software that we think should exist. Maybe it's something totally new, or maybe it's just a "good" version of an existing program. Either way, this is the place for the community to pitch and discuss ideas.

Head over to [Discussions](https://github.com/HandmadeNetwork/wishlist/discussions) to see people's suggestions and join in!
